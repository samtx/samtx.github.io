I can't stop listening to the They Might Be Giant's recording of Bob Mould's song ["Dog On Fire"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7KiXMfTe5M). You've heard it before. It's the theme song to The Daily Show with John Stewart.

I don't remember the first time I watched the Daily Show. It feels like it has always been there. I watched his show throughout middle school, high school, college, and the five years since then, a kind of north star of satire.

In the early 2000's, the voice-over during the Daily Show's opening sequence used to be *"This is the Daily Show with Jon Stewart, the most important television show... ever."* 

It's funny 'cause it's true.

Thanks for the laughs, Jon.
